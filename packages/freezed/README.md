Welcome to [Freezed], yet another code generator for unions/pattern-matching/copy.

# Motivation

While there are many code-generators available to help you deal with immutable objects, they usually come with a trade-off.\
Either they have a simple syntax but lack features, or they have very advanced
features but with complex syntax.

A typical example would be a "clone" method.\
Current generators have two approaches:

- a `copyWith`, usually implemented using `??`:

  ```dart
  MyClass copyWith({ int a, String b }) {
      return MyClass(a: a ?? this.a, b: b ?? this.b);
  }
  ```

  The syntax is very simple to use, but doesn't support some use-cases: nullable values.\
  We cannot use such `copyWith` to assign `null` to a property like so:

  ```dart
  person.copyWith(location: null)
  ```

* a builder method combined with a temporary mutable object, usually used this way:

  ```dart
  person.rebuild((person) {
    return person
      ..b = person;
  })
  ```

  The benefits of this approach are that it _does_ support nullable values.\
  On the other hand, the syntax is not very readable and fun to use.

**Say hello to [Freezed]~**, with support for advanced use-cases _without_ compromising on the syntax.

# How to use

## Install

To use [Freezed], you will need your typical [build_runner]/code-generator setup.\
First, install [build_runner] and [Freezed] by adding them to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
# pubspec.yaml
dependencies:
  freezed_annotation:

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner:
  freezed:
```

This installs three packages:

- [build_runner](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner), the tool to run code-generators
- [freezed], the code generator
- [freezed_annotation](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed_annotation), a package containing annotations for [freezed].

## Run the generator

Like most code-generators, [Freezed] will need you to both import the annotation ([meta])
and use the `part` keyword on the top of your files.

As such, a file that wants to use [Freezed] will start with:

```dart
import 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';

part 'my_file.freezed.dart';
```

**CONSIDER** also importing `package:flutter/foundation.dart`.\
The reason being, importing `foundation.dart` also imports classes to make an
object nicely readable in Flutter's devtool.\
If you import `foundation.dart`, [Freezed] will automatically do it for you.

A full example would be:

```dart
// main.dart
import 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';

part 'main.freezed.dart';

@freezed
abstract class Union with _$Union {
  const factory Union(int value) = Data;
  const factory Union.loading() = Loading;
  const factory Union.error([String message]) = ErrorDetails;
}
```

From there, to run the code generator, you have two possibilities:

- `flutter pub run build_runner build`, if your package depends on Flutter
- `pub run build_runner build` otherwise

## Ignore lint warnings on generated files

It is likely that the code generated by Freezed will cause your linter to
report warnings.

The solution to this problem is to tell the linter to ignore generated files,
by modifying your `analysis_options.yaml`:

```yaml
analyzer:
  exclude:
    - "**/*.g.dart"
    - "**/*.freezed.dart"
```

# The features

## The syntax

### Basics

[Freezed] works differently than most generators. To define a class using [Freezed],
you will not declare properties but instead factory constructors.

For example, if you want to define a `Person` class, which has 2 properties:

- name, a `String`
- age, an `int`

To do so, you will have to define a _factory constructor_ that takes these properties as parameter:

```dart
@freezed
abstract class Person with _$Person {
  factory Person({ String name, int age }) = _Person;
}
```

Which then allows you to write:

```dart
var person = Person(name: 'Remi', age: 24);
print(person.name); // Remi
print(person.age); // 24
```

**NOTE**:\
You do not have to use named parameters for your constructor.

All valid parameter syntaxes are supported. As such you could write:

```dart
@freezed
abstract class Person with _$Person {
  factory Person(String name, int age) = _Person;
}

Person('Remi', 24)
```

```dart
@freezed
abstract class Person with _$Person {
  const factory Person(String name, {int age}) = _Person;
}

Person('Remi', age: 24)
```

...

You are also not limited to one constructor and non-generic class.\
From example, you should write:

```dart
@freezed
abstract class Union<T> with _$Union<T> {
  const factory Union(T value) = Data<T>;
  const factory Union.loading() = Loading<T>;
  const factory Union.error([String message]) = ErrorDetails<T>;
}
```

See [unions/Sealed classes](#unionssealed-classes) for more information.

### Custom getters and methods

Sometimes, you may want to manually define methods/properties on that class.

But you will quickly notice that if you try to do:

```dart
@freezed
abstract class Person with _$Person {
  const factory Person(String name, {int age}) = _Person;

  void method() {
    print('hello world');
  }
}
```

then it won't work.

This is because by default, [Freezed] has no way of "extending" the class and
instead "implements" it.

To fix it, we need to give [Freezed] a way to use that `extends` keyword.\
To do so, we have to define a single private constructor as such:

```dart
@freezed
abstract class Person implements _$Person { // uses implements instead of with
  const Person._(); // Added constructor
  const factory Person(String name, {int age}) = _Person;

  void method() {
    print('hello world');
  }
}
```

### Asserts

A common use-case with classes is to want to add `assert(...)` statements to a
construtor:

```dart
class Person {
  Person({
    String name,
    int age,
  })  : assert(name.isNotEmpty, 'name cannot be empty'),
        assert(age >= 0);

  final String name;
  final int age;
}
```

Freezed supports this use-case through the `@Assert` decorator:

```dart
abstract class Person with _$Person {
  @Assert('name.isNotEmpty', 'name cannot be empty')
  @Assert('age >= 0')
  factory Person({
    String name,
    int age,
  }) = _Person;
}
```

### Non-nullable

[Freezed] is non-nullable ready and will promote null-safe code.\
This is done by automatically adding `assert(my_property != null)` whenever
non-nullable types would not compile.

What this means is, using [Freezed] you have to explicitly tell when a property
is nullable.

**What [Freezed] considers to be non-nullable**:

- non-optional parameters.
- optional positional parameters using `@Default`.
- named parameters decorated by `@required`

**What [Freezed] considers to be nullable**:

- optional parameters
- parameters decorated with `@nullable`

More concretely, if we define a `Person` class as such:

```dart
@freezed
abstract class Person with _$Person {
  const factory Person(
    String name, {
    @required int age,
    Gender gender,
  }) = _Person;
}
```

Then both `name` and `age` will be considered as **non-nullable**.\
On the other hand, `gender` will be nullable.
**nullable**.

Which means you could write:

```dart
Person('Remi', age: 24);
Person('Remi', age: 24, gender: Gender.male);
Person('Remi', age: 24, gender: null);
```

On the other hand, writing the following will result in an exception:

```dart
Person(null) // name cannot be null
Person('Remi') // age cannot be null
```

Then, when the time comes for to migrate to actual non-nullable types, you could
update your code to:

```dart
@freezed
abstract class Person with _$Person {
  const factory Person(
    String name, {
    required int age,
    Gender? gender,
  }) = _Person;
}
```

**Forcing a variable to be nullable**:

Sometimes, you may want to go against these rules and, for example, have a named
required parameter that is nullable.

To do so, you can decorate the desired property with `@nullable`.\
For example, if we wanted to make `age` from our previous example nullable, then
we would write:

```dart
@freezed
abstract class Person with _$Person {
  const factory Person(
    String name, {
    @nullable @required int age,
    Gender gender,
  }) = _Person;
}
```

This then allows us to write:

```dart
Person('Remi') // no longer throws an exception
```

### Default values

Unfortunately, Dart does not allow constructors with the syntax used by [Freezed]
to specify default values.

Which means you cannot write:

```dart
abstract class Example with _$Example {
  const factory Example([int value = 42]) = _Example;
}
```

But [Freezed] offers an alternative for this: `@Default`\
As such, you could rewrite the previous snippet this way:

```dart
abstract class Example with _$Example {
  const factory Example([@Default(42) int value]) = _Example;
}
```

**NOTE**:\
If you are using serialization/deserialization, this will automatically add
a `@JsonKey(defaultValue: <something>)` for you.

### Late

[Freezed] also contains early access to the upcoming `late` keyword.

If you are unfamiliar with that keyword, what `late` does is it allows variables
to be lazily initialized.

You may be familiar with such syntax:

```dart
Model _model;
Model get model => _model ?? _model = Model();
```

With Dart's `late` keyword, we could instead write:

```dart
late final model = Model();
```

And with [Freezed], we could write:

```dart
@late
Model get model => Model();
```

---

Since [Freezed] relies on immutable classes only, then this may be very helpful
for computed properties.

For example, you may write:

```dart
abstract class Todos with _$Todos {
  factory Todos(List<Todo> todos) = _Todos;

  @late
  List<Todo> get completed => todos.where((t) => t.completed).toList();
}
```

As opposed to a normal getter, this will _cache_ the result of `completed`, which
is more efficient.

**NOTE**:

Getters decorated with `@late` will also be visible on the generated `toString`.

### Constructor tear-off

A common use-case is to do a one-to-one mapping between the parameters of a callback
and a constructor.\
For example, you may write:

```dart
future.catchError((error) => MyClass.error(error))
```

But that's kind of redundant. As such, [Freezed] offers a simpler syntax:

```dart
future.catchError($MyClass.error)
```

This new code is strictly equivalent to the previous snippet, just shorter.

Note that this is both compatible with [default values](#default-values) and generics.

### Decorators and comments

[Freezed] supports property and class level decorators/documentation by
decorating/documenting their respective parameter and constructor definition.

Consider:

```dart
@freezed
abstract class Person with _$Person {
  const factory Person({
    String name,
    int age,
    Gender gender,
  }) = _Person;
}
```

If you want to document `name`, you can do:

```dart
@freezed
abstract class Person with _$Person {
  const factory Person({
    /// The name of the user.
    ///
    /// Must not be null
    String name,
    int age,
    Gender gender,
  }) = _Person;
}
```

If you want to mark the property `gender` as `@deprecated`, then you can do:

```dart
@freezed
abstract class Person with _$Person {
  const factory Person({
    String name,
    int age,
    @deprecated Gender gender,
  }) = _Person;
}
```

This will deprecate both:

- The constructor
  ```dart
  Person(gender: Gender.something); // gender is deprecated
  ```
- The generated class's constructor:
  ```dart
  _Person(gender: Gender.something); // gender is deprecated
  ```
- the property:
  ```dart
  Person person;
  print(person.gender); // gender is deprecated
  ```
- the `copyWith` parameter:
  ```dart
  Person person;
  person.copyWith(gender: Gender.something); // gender is deprecated
  ```

Similarly, if you want to decorate the generated class you can decorate the
defining factory constructor.

As such, to deprecate `_Person`, you could do:

```dart
@freezed
abstract class Person with _$Person {
  @deprecated
  const factory Person({
    String name,
    int age,
    Gender gender,
  }) = _Person;
}
```

### Mixins and Interfaces for individual classes for union types

When you have multiple types in the same class you might want to make
one of those types to implement a interface or mixin a class. You can do
that using the `@Implements` decorator or `@With` respectively. In this
case `City` is implementing with `GeographicArea`.

```dart
abstract class GeographicArea {
  int get population;
  String get name;
}

@freezed
abstract class Example with _$Example {
  const factory Example.person(String name, int age) = Person;

  @Implements(GeographicArea)
  const factory Example.city(String name, int population) = City;
}
```

In case you want to specify a generic mixin or interface you need to
declare it as a string using the `With.fromString` constructor,
`Implements.fromString` respectively. Similar `Street` is mixing with
`AdministrativeArea<House>`.

```dart
abstract class GeographicArea {}
abstract class House {}
abstract class Shop {}
abstract class AdministrativeArea<T> {}

@freezed
abstract class Example with _$Example {
  const factory Example.person(String name, int age) = Person;

  @With.fromString('AdministrativeArea<House>')
  const factory Example.street(String name) = Street;

  @With(House)
  @Implements(Shop)
  @Implements(GeographicArea)
  const factory Example.city(String name, int population) = City;
}
```

In case you want to make your class generic, you do it like this:

```dart
@freezed
abstract class Example<T> with _$Example<T> {
  const factory Example.person(String name, int age) = Person<T>;

  @With.fromString('AdministrativeArea<T>')
  const factory Example.street(String name, T value) = Street<T>;

  @With(House)
  @Implements(GeographicArea)
  const factory Example.city(String name, int population) = City<T>;
}
```

**Note**: You need to make sure that you comply with the interface
requirements by implementing all the abstract members. If the interface
has no members or just fields, you can fulfil the interface contract by
adding them in the constructor of the union type. Keep in mind that if
the interface defines a method or a getter, that you implement in the
class, you need to use the
[Custom getters and methods](#custom-getters-and-methods) instructions.

**Note 2**: You cannot use `@With`/`@Implements` with freezed classes.
Freezed classes can neither be extended nor implemented.

## ==/toString

When using [Freezed], the `toString`, `hashCode` and `==` methods are overridden
as you would expect:

```dart
@freezed
abstract class Person with _$Person {
  factory Person({ String name, int age }) = _Person;
}


void main() {
  print(Person(name: 'Remi', age: 24)); // Person(name: Remi, age: 24)

  print(
    Person(name: 'Remi', age: 24) == Person(name: 'Remi', age: 24),
  ); // true
}
```

## copyWith

As stated in the very beginning of this readme, [Freezed] does not compromise
on the syntax to have a powerful copy.

The `copyWith` method generated by [Freezed] **does** support assigning a value
to `null`.\
For example, if we take our previous `Person` class:

```dart
@freezed
abstract class Person with _$Person {
  factory Person(String name, int age) = _Person;
}
```

Then we could write:

```dart
var person = Person('Remi', 24);

// `age` not passed, its value is preserved
print(person.copyWith(name: 'Dash')); // Person(name: Dash, age: 24)
// `age` is set to `null`
print(person.copyWith(age: null)); // Person(name: Remi, age: null)
```

Notice how `copyWith` correctly was able to understand `null` parameters.

### Deep copy

While `copyWith` is very powerful in itself, it starts to get inconvenient on more complex objects.

Consider the following classes:

```dart
@freezed
abstract class Company with _$Company {
  factory Company({String name, Director director}) = _Company;
}

@freezed
abstract class Director with _$Director {
  factory Director({String name, Assistant assistant}) = _Director;
}

@freezed
abstract class Assistant with _$Assistant {
  factory Assistant({String name, int age}) = _Assistant;
}
```

Then, from a reference on `Company`, we may want to perform changes on `Assistant`.\
For example, to change the `name` of an assistant, using `copyWith` we would have to write:

```dart
Company company;

Company newCompany = company.copyWith(
  director: company.director.copyWith(
    assistant: company.director.assistant.copyWith(
      name: 'John Smith',
    ),
  ),
);
```

This _works_, but is relatively verbose with a lot of duplicates.\
This is where we could use [Freezed]'s "deep copy".

If an object decorated using `@freezed` contains other objects decorated with
`@freezed`, then [Freezed] will offer an alternate syntax to the previous example:

```dart
Company company;

Company newCompany = company.copyWith.director.assistant(name: 'John Smith');
```

This snippet will achieve strictly the same result as the previous snippet
(creating a new company with an updated assistant name), but no longer has duplicates.

Going deeper in this syntax, if instead, we wanted to change the director's name
then we could write:

```dart
Company company;
Company newCompany = company.copyWith.director(name: 'John Doe');
```

Overall, based on the definitions of `Company`/`Director`/`Assistant` mentioned above,
all the following "copy" syntaxes will work:

```dart
Company company;

company = company.copyWith(name: 'Google', director: Director(...));
company = company.copyWith.director(name: 'Larry', assistant: Assistant(...));
company = company.copyWith.director.assistant(name: 'John', age: 42);
```

**Null consideration**

Some objects may can also be `null`. For example, using our `Company` class,
then `Director` may be `null`.

As such, writing:

```dart
Company company = Company(name: 'Google', director: null);
Company newCompany = company.copyWith.director.assistant(name: 'John');
```

doesn't make sense.\
We can't change the director's assistant if there is no director to begin with.\

In that situation, `company.copyWith.director` will return `null`, and our previous
example will result in a null exception.

To fix it, we can use the `?.` operator and write:

```dart
Company newCompany = company.copyWith.director?.assistant(name: 'John');
```

## Unions/Sealed classes

Coming from other languages, you may be used with features like "tagged union types" / sealed classes/pattern matching.\
These are powerful tools in combination with a type system, but Dart currently does not support them.

But fear not, [Freezed] supports them all, by using a syntax similar to Kotlin.

Defining a union/sealed class with [Freezed] is simple: write multiple constructors:

```dart
@freezed
abstract class Union with _$Union {
  const factory Union(int value) = Data;
  const factory Union.loading() = Loading;
  const factory Union.error([String message]) = ErrorDetails;
}
```

This snippet defines a class with three states.\
Note how we gave meaningful names to the right hand of the factory constructors we defined.
They will come in handy later.

### Shared properties

When defining multiple constructors, you will lose the ability to read properties that are not common to all constructors:

For example, if you write:

```dart
@freezed
abstract class Example with _$Example {
  const factory Example.person(String name, int age) = Person;
  const factory Example.city(String name, int population) = City;
}
```

Then you will be unable to read `age` and `population` directly:

```dart
var example = Example.person('Remi', 24);
print(example.age); // does not compile!
```

On the other hand, you **can** read properties that are defined on all constructors.\
For example, the `name` variable is common to both `Example.person` and `Example.city` constructors.

As such we can write:

```dart
var example = Example.person('Remi', 24);
print(example.name); // Remi
example = Example.city('London', 8900000);
print(example.name); // London
```

You also **can** use `copyWith` with properties defined on all constructors:

```dart
var example = Example.person('Remi', 24);
print(example.copyWith(name: 'Dash')); // Example.person(name: Dash, age: 24)

example = Example.city('London', 8900000);
print(example.copyWith(name: 'Paris')); // Example.city(name: Paris, population: 8900000)
```

To be able to read the other properties, you can use pattern matching thanks to the generated methods:

- [when](#when)
- [maybeWhen](#maybeWhen)
- [map](#mapMaybeMap)
- [maybeMap](#mapMaybeMap)

Alternatively, you can use the `is` operator:

```dart
var example = Example.person('Remi', 24);
if (example is Person) {
  print(example.age); // 24
}
```

### When

The [when] method is the equivalent to pattern matching with destructing.\
Its prototype depends on the constructors defined.

For example, with:

```dart
@freezed
abstract class Union with _$Union {
  const factory Union(int value) = Data;
  const factory Union.loading() = Loading;
  const factory Union.error([String message]) = ErrorDetails;
}
```

Then [when] will be:

```dart
var union = Union(42);

print(
  union.when(
    (int value) => 'Data $data',
    loading: () => 'loading',
    error: (String message) => 'Error: $message',
  ),
); // Data 42
```

Whereas if we defined:

```dart
@freezed
abstract class Model with _$Model {
  factory Model.first(String a) = First;
  factory Model.second(int b, bool c) = Second;
}
```

Then [when] will be:

```dart
var model = Model.first('42');

print(
  model.when(
    first: (String a) => 'first $a',
    second: (int b, bool c) => 'second $b $c'
  ),
); // first 42
```

Notice how each callback matches with a constructor's name and prototype.

**NOTE**:\
All callbacks are required and must not be `null`.\
If that is not what you want, consider using [maybeWhen].

### MaybeWhen

The [maybeWhen] method is equivalent to [when], but doesn't require all callbacks
to be specified.

On the other hand, it adds an extra `orElse` required parameter, for fallback behavior.

As such, using:

```dart
@freezed
abstract class Union with _$Union {
  const factory Union(int value) = Data;
  const factory Union.loading() = Loading;
  const factory Union.error([String message]) = ErrorDetails;
}
```

Then we could write:

```dart
var union = Union(42);

print(
  union.maybeWhen(
    null, // ignore the default case
    loading: () => 'loading',
    // did not specify an `error` callback
    orElse: () => 'fallback',
  ),
); // fallback
```

This is equivalent to:

```dart
var union = Union(42);

String label;
if (union is Loading) {
  label = 'loading';
} else {
  label = 'fallback';
}
```

But it is safer as you are forced to handle the fallback case, and it is easier to write.

### Map/MaybeMap

The [map] and [maybeMap] methods are equivalent to [when]/[maybeWhen], but **without** destructuring.

Consider this class:

```dart
@freezed
abstract class Model with _$Model {
  factory Model.first(String a) = First;
  factory Model.second(int b, bool c) = Second;
}
```

With such class, while [when] will be:

```dart
var model = Model.first('42');

print(
  model.when(
    first: (String a) => 'first $a',
    second: (int b, bool c) => 'second $b $c'
  ),
); // first 42
```

[map] will instead be:

```dart
var model = Model.first('42');

print(
  model.map(
    first: (First value) => 'first ${value.a}',
    second: (Second value) => 'second ${value.b} ${value.c}'
  ),
); // first 42
```

This can be useful if you want to do complex operations, like [copyWith]/`toString` for example:

```dart
var model = Model.second(42, false)
print(
  model.map(
    first: (value) => value,
    second: (value) => value.copyWith(c: true),
  )
); // Model.second(b: 42, c: true)
```

## FromJson/ToJson

While [Freezed] will not generate your typical `fromJson`/`toJson` by itself, it knowns
what [json_serializable] is.

Making a class compatible with [json_serializable] is very straightforward.

Consider this snippet:

```dart
import 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';

part 'model.freezed.dart';

@freezed
abstract class Model with _$Model {
  factory Model.first(String a) = First;
  factory Model.second(int b, bool c) = Second;
}
```

The changes necessary to make it compatible with [json_serializable] consists of two lines:

- a new `part`: `part 'model.g.dart';`
- a new constructor on the targeted class: `factory Model.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$ModelFromJson(json);`

The end result is:

```dart
import 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';

part 'model.freezed.dart';
part 'model.g.dart';

@freezed
abstract class Model with _$Model {
  factory Model.first(String a) = First;
  factory Model.second(int b, bool c) = Second;

  factory Model.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$ModelFromJson(json);
}
```

That's it!\
With these changes, [Freezed] will automatically ask [json_serializable] to generate all the necessary
`fromJson`/`toJson`.

### fromJSON - classes with multiple constructors

For classes with multiple constructors, [Freezed] will check the JSON response
for a string element called `runtimeType` and choose the constructor to use based
on its value. For example, given the following constructors:

```dart
@freezed
abstract class MyResponse with _$MyResponse {
  const factory MyResponse(String a) = MyResponseData;
  const factory MyResponse.special(String a, int b) = MyResponseSpecial;
  const factory MyResponse.error(String message) = MyResponseError;

  factory MyResponse.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$MyResponseFromJson(json);
}
```

Then [Freezed] will use each JSON object's `runtimeType` to choose the constructor as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "runtimeType": "default",
    "a": "This JSON object will use constructor MyResponse()"
  },
  {
    "runtimeType": "special",
    "a": "This JSON object will use constructor MyResponse.special()",
    "b": 42
  },
  {
    "runtimeType": "error",
    "message": "This JSON object will use constructor MyResponse.error()"
  }
]
```

You can customize this key to replace `runtimeType` with something different
using the `@Freezed` decorator:

```dart
@Freezed(unionKey: 'type')
abstract class MyResponse with _$MyResponse {
  // ...
}
```

which would update the previous json to:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "default",
    "a": "This JSON object will use constructor MyResponse()"
  },
  {
    "type": "special",
    "a": "This JSON object will use constructor MyResponse.special()",
    "b": 42
  },
  {
    "type": "error",
    "message": "This JSON object will use constructor MyResponse.error()"
  }
]
```

If you don't control the JSON response, then you can implement a custom converter.
Your custom converter will need to implement its own logic for determining which
constructor to use.

```dart
class MyResponseConverter implements JsonConverter<MyResponse, Map<String, dynamic>> {
  const MyResponseConverter();

  @override
  MyResponse fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    if (json == null) {
      return null;
    }
    // type data was already set (e.g. because we serialized it ourselves)
    if (json['runtimeType'] != null) {
      return MyResponse.fromJson(json);
    }
    // you need to find some condition to know which type it is. e.g. check the presence of some field in the json
    if (isTypeData) {
      return MyResponseData.fromJson(json);
    } else if (isTypeSpecial) {
      return MyResponseSpecial.fromJson(json);
    } else if (isTypeError) {
      return MyResponseError.fromJson(json);
    } else {
      throw Exception('Could not determine the constructor for mapping from JSON');
    }
 }

  @override
  Map<String, dynamic> toJson(MyResponse data) => data.toJson();
}
```

To then apply your custom converter pass the decorator to a constructor parameter.

```dart
@freezed
abstract class MyModel with _$MyModel {
  const factory MyModel(@MyResponseConverter() MyResponse myResponse) = MyModelData;

  factory MyModel.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$MyModelFromJson(json);
}
```

By doing this, json serializable will use `MyResponseConverter.fromJson()` and `MyResponseConverter.toJson()` to convert `MyResponse`.

You can also use a custom converter on a constructor parameter contained in a `List`.

```dart
@freezed
abstract class MyModel with _$MyModel {
  const factory MyModel(@MyResponseConverter() List<MyResponse> myResponse) = MyModelData;

  factory MyModel.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$MyModelFromJson(json);
}
```

**Note**:  
In order to serialize nested lists of freezed objects, you are supposed to either
specify a `@JsonSerializable(explicitToJson: true)` or change `explicit_to_json`
inside your `build.yaml` file ([see the documentation](https://github.com/google/json_serializable.dart/tree/master/json_serializable#build-configuration)).

**What about `@JsonKey` annotation?**

All decorators passed to a constructor parameter are "copy-pasted" to the generated
property too.\
As such, you can write:

```dart
@freezed
abstract class Example with _$Example {
  factory Example(@JsonKey(name: 'my_property') String myProperty) = _Example;

  factory Example.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$ExampleFromJson(json);
}
```

**What about `@JsonSerializable` annotation?**

You can pass `@JsonSerializable` annotation by placing it over constructor e.g.:

```dart
@freezed
abstract class Example with _$Example {
  @JsonSerializable(explicit_to_json: true)
  factory Example(@JsonKey(name: 'my_property') SomeOtherClass myProperty) = _Example;

  factory Example.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$ExampleFromJson(json);
}
```

If you want to define some custom json_serializable flags for all the classes (e.g. `explicit_to_json` or `any_map`) you can do it via `build.yaml` file as described [here](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable#build-configuration).

### Freezed extension for VSCode

The [Freezed](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=blaxou.freezed) extension might help you work faster with freezed. For example :

- Use `Ctrl+Shift+B` (`Cmd+Shift+B` on Mac) to quickly build using `build_runner`.
- Quickly generate a Freezed class by using `Ctrl+Shift+P` > `Generate Freezed class`.


### Freezed extension for IntelliJ
You can get the Intellij Live Templates for Freezed boiler plate code [here](https://github.com/Tinhorn/freezed_intellij_live_templates).

For example:

- type __freezedClass__ and press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to generate a freezed class
  ```dart
  @freezed
  abstract class Demo with _$Demo {
  }
  ```
- type __freezedFromJson__ and press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to generate the fromJson method for json_serializable
  ```dart
  factory Demo.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$DemoFromJson(json);
  ```
