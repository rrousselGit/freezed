Welcome to the Macro version of [Freezed]!  
Freezed is a tool that generates `toString`, `copyWith` (including `copyWith(field: null)`), `hashCode`, `==`
and more.

This is a very early proof of concept about what Freezed would look like when macros land in Dart.
Beware: Due to many missing Macro features, lots of Freezed features are
missing or broken. Use at your own risk :)

## Installation

To get started with the macro version of Freezed:

- Make sure that you use a Dart version >= 3.5.0-dev
- Enable `macros` in your `analysis_options.yaml` as followed:

```yaml
# analysis_options.yaml
analyzer:
  enable-experiment:
    - macros
```

## Usage

Two possible syntaxes are supported:

- Constructor-first.
  You define a class with a constructor, and the macro will
  generate fields for you.
  This gives fine-grained control over positional vs named parameters.
  It offers the ability to use asserts, `super`, ...
  Although macros have still lots of things related to this that don't work.
  So although the syntax is very flexible, lots of things are not supported yet.

- Field-first.
  You define a class with fields, and the macro will generate a constructor for you.
  This is the most stable syntax.
  But it is less flexible, and not very dart-like.
  If you want full control over constructors, you'll have to use the constructor-first syntax.

### Constructor-first usage

To use the constructor-first syntax, define a class with a constructor,
but no fields:

```dart
@Freezed()
class Example {
  Example({required int foo, required String bar});
}
```

The macro will generate the fields for you, along with
the various methods.

```dart
void main() {
  final example = Example(foo: 42, bar: '42');
  print(example.foo); // 42
}
```

#### Using named constructors.

Naturally, the macro expects that you use the default constructor.
If you wish to generate fields based on a named constructor instead,
specify `@Freezed(constructor: '<constructor name>')`.

```dart
@Freezed(constructor: 'custom')
class Example {
 Example.custom({required int foo, required String bar});
}
```

### Field-first usage

To use the field-first syntax, define a class with fields
but default constructor.
The macro will then generate a constructor for you, along
with the various methods.

```dart
@Freezed()
class Example {
 final int foo;
 final String bar;
}
```

Currently, all fields are "named" parameters, and they are optional if they are nullable.

```dart
void main() {
 final example = Example(foo: 42, bar: '42');
 print(example.foo); // 42
}
```

#### Specifying the constructor name

If you wish to generate a non-default constructor,
you can specify `@Freezed(constructor: '<constructor name>')`.

```dart
@Freezed(constructor: 'custom')
class Example {
  final int foo;
}

void main() {
  final example = Example.custom(foo: 42);
}
```
