# 0.13.0-nullsafety.2

- Excluded getters and late variables from the generated `toString` as they could potentially cause a StackOverflow

# 0.13.0-nullsafety.1

  the `required keyword, leading to a compilation error (see #351).

# 0.13.0-nullsafety.0

Migrated to null safety

# 0.12.7

- fixed a bug where `///` above a constructor could cause the generation to stop working (see also https://github.com/rrousselGit/freezed/issues/326)

- Fix Freezed generating code from constructors that do not rely on Freezed (https://github.com/rrousselGit/freezed/issues/323)

# 0.12.5

# 0.12.3-dev

- Renamed `Result` in generated code to `TResult` to avoid naming conflicts
- Fixes `InconsistentAnalysisException` sometimes being thrown (https://github.com/rrousselGit/freezed/issues/294)

# 0.12.2

- Upgrade the depenencies (analyzer, build_runner)
- fixed a bug where a custom `fromJson` constructor still generated the `fromJson`
  constructor with json_serializable
  (see also https://github.com/rrousselGit/freezed/issues/280)
- fixed a generation issue when `unionKey` contains special characters
  (see also https://github.com/rrousselGit/freezed/issues/274)

# 0.12.1

- Removed dependency on `_fe_analyzer_shared`

# 0.12.0

- Added `/// @nodoc` on objects generated by Freezed that starts with `$`
  to not pollute dartdoc.

- Added support for documenting properties, by documenting the constructor parameters:

  ```dart
  @freezed
  abstract class Example with _$Example {
    const factory Example(
      /// Some documentation
      String parameter,
    ) = Person;
  }
  ```

- Added `Assert` decorator to generate `assert(...)` statements on Freezed classes:

  ```dart
  @freezed
  abstract class Person with _$Person {
    @Assert('name.trim().isNotEmpty', 'name cannot be empty')
    @Assert('age >= 0')
    factory Person({
      String name,
      int age,
    }) = _Person;
  }
  ```

- Now generates a constructor tear-off for `fromJson` too:

  ```dart
  @freezed
  abstract class Person with _$Person {
    factory Person({ String name, int age}) = _Person;

    factory Person.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$PersonFromJson(json);
  }

  List<Map<String, dynamic>> list;

  List<MyClass> persons = list.map($Person.fromJson).toList();
  ```

- Added a way to customize the de/serialization of union types using the
  `@Freezed(unionKey: 'my-key')` decorator.

# 0.11.1

- Further improve the parsing of recursive freezed class to avoid `dynamic`s

# 0.11.0

- Added `@With` and `@Implements` decorators to allow only a specific constructor
  of a union type to implement an interface:

  ```dart
  @freezed
  abstract class Example with _$Example {
    const factory Example.person(String name, int age) = Person;

    @Implements(GeographicArea)
    const factory Example.city(String name, int population) = City;
  }
  ```
