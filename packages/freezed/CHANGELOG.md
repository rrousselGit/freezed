# 2.0.5

Increase minimum analyzer version.

# 2.0.4

Fixes a bug where using `@unfreezed` on unions somehow still generated immutable properties.

# 2.0.3+1

Update warning message when using abstract freezed classes

# 2.0.3

– fix: performance regression with ==/hashCode/copyWith due to immutable collections (#653)
– fix: build.yaml decoding crash
- fix: remove annotations on internal properties related to immutable collections (#659)

# 2.0.2

Fixed invalid generated code when defining nullable collections.

# 2.0.1

- Fixed a bug where the generated when/map methods were potentially invalid when
  using default values
- Fixed a bug where when/map methods were generated even when not necessary

# 2.0.0

- **Breaking**: freezed_annotation no-longer exports the entire package:collection
- **Breaking**: Freezed no-longer generates `$MyClassTearOff`. This feature is now available in Dart
- **Breaking** Removed `@Freezed(maybeMap: )` & `@Freezed(maybeWhen: )` in favor of a separate:

  ```Dart
  @Freezed(map: FreezedMap(...), when: FreezedWhenOptions(...))
  ```

- **Breaking**: Freezed now converts Lists/Maps/Sets into UnmodifiableListView/UnmodifiableMapView/UnmodifiableSetView.
  This can be disabled for one class by specifying `@Freezed(makeCollectionsUnmodifiable: false)`.
  Alternatively, this can be configured inside the `build.yaml` file

- Added parameters of `@Freezed` to customize the generated code.
  This includes: fromJson, toJson, map, when, equal, toStringOverride, copyWith.

  These parameters allow disabling code that would otherwise be generated.
  It also allows forcing the generation even if it would otherwise not be generated.

- Upgraded the analyzer version to 3.0.0

# 1.1.0

Added support for disabling the generation of `maybeMap`/`maybeWhen` (thanks to @Lyokone)

# 1.0.2+1

Updated the README

# 1.0.2

Fixed a regression with the ==/hashCode implementation generated for
classes with custom implementations of `List`/`Map`/... (see https://github.com/rrousselGit/freezed/issues/561)

# 1.0.1

Fixed an issue where some `build.yaml` options were not properly considered.
This includes changing where the generated files should be placed. (Thanks to @sperochon)

# 1.0.0

Freezed is now stable

This release also:

- reverted an involuntary change of how union types were de/serialized, breaking
  existing code.
- fixed an issue with generic typedefs (thanks to @SunlightBro #552)
- fixed a potential null exception

# 0.15.1+1

- Fixed a bug where the generated code for serializable unions with a base class was invalid

# 0.15.1

- The union key is no longer passed `json_serializable` when deserializing avoid the case of being an `unrecognized_key` in some cases.
- Updated dependencies
- Increased minimum Dart SDK required to 2.14.0
- Fixed an issue where classes with a $ in their name could cause Freezed to fail (Thanks to @comigor #542)
- When using typedefs, the generated code now tries to use the typedef too
  if possible, instead of the aliased type (Thanks to @Norbert515 #536).
- Added support for custom ==/hashCode implementation (Thanks to @casvanluijtelaa #526)
- When writing a custom `toJson` function, it will now always take precedence over
  the default implementation generated by Freezed.

# 0.15.0+1

Fixed the generated `hashCode` not compiling for objects with a large number
of properties. (#531)

# 0.15.0

- **Breaking** Changed the syntax for `@With` and `@Implements` to use a generic annotation.
  Before:

  ```dart
  @With(MyClass)
  @With.fromString('Generic<int>')
  ```

  After:

  ```dart
  @With<MyClass>()
  @With<Generic<int>>()
  ```

- Fixed an issue with fromJson tear-offs not allowing `Object?` as map value. (#520)
- Optimized the generated implementation of `hashCode` and `==`
- Fixed an issue when `MyClass<Object>()` and `MyClass<int>()` could be considered equal
- Require Dart SDK >=2.14.0.

# 0.14.5

- fixed a bug when using alias imports, potentially using the prefix on every variables.
- When `@Freezed(fallback: '...')` is specified and using `fromJson`, now
  support cases where the JSON does not contain the "key".

# 0.14.4

- Now supports types coming from `import '...' as alias;`
- generated .freezed.dart are now excluded from code coverage reports.
- if `toString` is overridden, Freezed no-longer applies `Diagnosticable` which would break the `toString` (fixes #221)
- Add `union.whenOrNull` and `union.mapOrNull`, similar to `maybeWhen` and `maybeMap`
  but instead of an `orElse` they return `null`.

# 0.14.3

- Upgraded to support json_serializable 5.0.0
- `fromJson` now throws `CheckedFromJsonException` if it fails to deserialize an object.
- fixed an issue where optional dynamic keys were not allowed.

# 0.14.2

- Added the ability to specify a fallback constructor when deserializing unions (thanks to @Brazol)

# 0.14.1+3

Upgrade dependencies

# 0.14.1+2

Fixed examples in the README

# 0.14.1+1

- Fixed issues with recursive Freezed classes that could cause the parameter type to be inferred as `dynamic` (see #399)
- Updated `build` and other similar dependencies to latest

# 0.14.1

- Added the ability to customise the JSON value of a union. See https://github.com/rrousselGit/freezed#fromjson---classes-with-multiple-constructors for more information (Thanks to @ookami-kb)

- Fix an issue where Freezed would not generate code properly if `freezed_annotation`
  was indirectly imported (by importing a library that exports `freezed_annotation`) (Thanks to @ookami-kb)

# 0.14.0+2

- Fix `@Assert` no-longer working
- Fixed an issue where a `factory` using the `=>` syntax (so not managed by Freezed)
  with default values could break code-generation.

# 0.14.0+1

- fix `sort_unnamed_constructors_first` and `cast_nullable_to_non_nullable` in the generated code (Thanks to @gaetschwartz #372)

# 0.14.0

- Stable null-safety release
- Upgraded `analyzer` to support latest versions
- Freezed classes no-longer need to be abstract.  
  Before:

  ```dart
  @freezed
  abstract class Example with _$Example {
    factory Example(int value) = _Example;
  }
  ```

  after:

  ```dart
  @freezed
  class Example with _$Example {
    factory Example(int value) = _Example;
  }
  ```

  This leads to better error messages when a Freezed class uses interfaces/mixins
  but the class is missing a specific property.

- It is now allowed to add unimplemented getter to Freezed classes.
  This can be useful to guarantee that union-types all have a common property:

  ```dart
  @freezed
  class Union with _$Union {
    const factory Union.left(int value) = _Left;
    const factory Union.right(int value) = _Left;

    @override
    int get value; // adding this forces all union cases to possess a `value` property
  }
  ```

- Excluded getters and late variables from the generated `toString` as they could potentially cause a StackOverflow
- Fixed a bug causing properties with annotations to generate the annotations _before_
  the `required keyword, leading to a compilation error (see #351).

# 0.14.0-nullsafety.1

- Upgraded `analyzer` to support latest versions

# 0.14.0-nullsafety.0

- Freezed classes no-longer need to be abstract.  
  Before:

  ```dart
  @freezed
  abstract class Example with _$Example {
    factory Example(int value) = _Example;
  }
  ```

  after:

  ```dart
  @freezed
  class Example with _$Example {
    factory Example(int value) = _Example;
  }
  ```

    const factory Union.right(int value) = _Left;

    @override
    int get value; // adding this forces all union cases to possess a `value` property
  }
  ```

# 0.13.0-nullsafety.2

- Excluded getters and late variables from the generated `toString` as they could potentially cause a StackOverflow

# 0.13.0-nullsafety.1

  (see also https://github.com/rrousselGit/freezed/issues/274)

# 0.12.1

- Removed dependency on `_fe_analyzer_shared`

# 0.12.0

- Added `/// @nodoc` on objects generated by Freezed that starts with `$`
  to not pollute dartdoc.

- Added support for documenting properties, by documenting the constructor parameters:

  ```dart
  @freezed
  abstract class Example with _$Example {
    const factory Example(
      /// Some documentation
      String parameter,
    ) = Person;
  }
  ```

- Added `Assert` decorator to generate `assert(...)` statements on Freezed classes:

  ```dart
  @freezed
  abstract class Person with _$Person {
    @Assert('name.trim().isNotEmpty', 'name cannot be empty')
    @Assert('age >= 0')
    factory Person({
      String name,
      int age,
    }) = _Person;
  }
  ```

- Now generates a constructor tear-off for `fromJson` too:

  ```dart
  @freezed
  abstract class Person with _$Person {
    factory Person({ String name, int age}) = _Person;

    factory Person.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$PersonFromJson(json);
  }

  List<Map<String, dynamic>> list;

  List<MyClass> persons = list.map($Person.fromJson).toList();
  ```

- Added a way to customize the de/serialization of union types using the
  `@Freezed(unionKey: 'my-key')` decorator.

    const factory Example.person(String name, int age) = Person;

    @Implements(GeographicArea)
    const factory Example.city(String name, int population) = City;
